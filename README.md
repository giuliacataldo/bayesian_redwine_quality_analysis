# bayesian_redwine_quality_analysis
This was the final project of my Bayesian Modeling course and I worked on it with a classmate of mine.
Our goal was to perform a Bayesian analysis on a dataset of our choice.
We used a dataset containing grades given by experts to red wines and their respective physiochemical properties.
Since we were dealing with prdered cathegories, we implemented two different probit models, the first being a binomial model, and the second a multivariate model.
We studied the bayesian theories behind these approaches, then proceeded to compare the models and draw conclusions.
